  "body": "## Kipa: A system to improve OCCC visitation scheduling\r\n\r\n*Scheduling is easy to do if you are willing to do it poorly.*\r\n\r\nDoing scheduling poorly means one or both of the following:\r\n\r\n  * You are willing to invest a lot of time or money doing it.\r\n  * You are willing to fail to schedule frequently.\r\n  \r\nThe [Oahu Community Correctional Facility](http://dps.hawaii.gov/about/divisions/corrections/occc/) currently attempts to schedule approximately 350 visits per week through a single phone line and a spreadsheet. This is \"poor scheduling\" in both senses:  OCCC staff spend over 30 hours a week on the phone with potential visitors, and many visitors cannot succeed in visiting their loved one due to an inability to get through to OCCC staff, or through failure to understand and comply with requirements for visitation. This has health and safety implications: visitation is a key part of the rehabilitation process, so improving the scheduling process can help yield better correctional outcomes. \r\n   \r\nThe design of Kipa takes into account the following issues in OCCC scheduling:\r\n\r\n* OCCC detainees are allowed up to 12 visitors, and must provide staff with those names. \r\n* Visitors must submit documentation to OCCC in order to be authorized to request visits. \r\n* Once authorized, visitors and OCCC staff must agree upon a 30 minute time slot during the next seven days.\r\n* Visitors must dress appropriately and bring additional documentation at the time of the visit.\r\n* Unpredictable changes in staffing resources means that visits might be cancelled at the last minute. \r\n* There are over 6,000 potential visitors, and the pool of visitors is constantly changing as detainees enter and exit OCCC.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nOur vision for Kipa is to create technology that reduces the time, expense, and failure rate for OCCC visitation scheduling.\r\n\r\n#### Benefits to visitors\r\n\r\nWhile the phone line will still be available, most visitors will not need to use it. Instead, they will use Kipa (via a desktop computer or mobile phone) to guide them through the scheduling process. \r\n\r\nRecognizing that the OCCC visitor population varies broadly in technological sophistication, the Kipa system will use text messaging whenever possible for communication with visitors.  For example, Kipa will automatically generate a text message to visitors when:\r\n\r\n* A visitor has become authorized to request visits. The text message will provide instructions on how to start requesting visits.\r\n* A visitor's request for a visit has been approved. The text message will indicate the time and date of the approved visit.\r\n* The day of a visit has arrived. The text message will remind them of the time, the required dress code, and required documentation.\r\n* A scheduled visit must be cancelled due to OCCC staffing issues or other problems. The text message will tell the visitor that the visit has been cancelled and provide instructions on how to reschedule.\r\n\r\n#### Benefits to OCCC staff\r\n\r\nOne goal is a dramatic reduction in the need to schedule visits via the phone. Although phone-based scheduling will still be available, we believe that text message-enabled phones are available to almost all of the visitor population, and that they will find this a faster, more effective, less error prone, and less stressful way to manage visits with their loved ones. \r\n\r\nA second goal is to reduce non-compliance with OCCC policies regarding visitation. Visitors will have easier access to rules regarding documentation and dress code, and the system will automatically generate reminders on the day of the visit.  \r\n\r\nA third goal is to simplify visit cancellation procedures.  If an unforeseen event results in cancellation of one or more visitation sessions, OCCC staff can use Kipa to generate text messages to visitors informing them of the cancellation and providing instructions on how to reschedule. \r\n\r\n## Kipa in action\r\n\r\nKipa currently implements a workflow based on about a dozen pages. \r\n\r\nAll users start at the following home page:\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/HACC2016/teamkipa/raw/master/doc/mockups/home.png)\r\n\r\nAdmins and registered users can go to the login page.  New visitors must \"Request authorization\":\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/HACC2016/teamkipa/raw/master/doc/mockups/register.png)\r\n\r\nA new user, once they submit their information, must wait to be authorized by OCCC staff. During that time their home page displays this:\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/HACC2016/teamkipa/raw/master/doc/mockups/authorization-pending.png)\r\n\r\nIf OCCC staff decline the visitor's request for visitation rights, the home page becomes this:\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/HACC2016/teamkipa/raw/master/doc/mockups/authorization-declined.png)\r\n\r\nIf OCCC staff approve the request, the home page enables them to make a visit request:\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/HACC2016/teamkipa/raw/master/doc/mockups/request-visit.png)\r\n\r\nAccording to OCCC staff, it is OK for such requests to be immediately approved. So, the home page shows the following after selecting a visit time:\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/HACC2016/teamkipa/raw/master/doc/mockups/reserved-visit.png)\r\n\r\nThe user can cancel and re-reserve visits as they like during the seven day interval.\r\n\r\nOnce the visit has happened, the home page goes back to enabling them to reserve a new visit.\r\n\r\nThis workflow involves interaction with OCCC staff for approval processing. Here is the admin page:\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/HACC2016/teamkipa/raw/master/doc/mockups/admin-home-page.png)\r\n\r\nIn order to approve a request to become an authorized visitor, an admin can click on the name of a user requesting this status to go to this page:\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/HACC2016/teamkipa/raw/master/doc/mockups/admin-process-authorization.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nDownload and install the latest version of [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/).\r\n\r\nBring up a shell, and cd into the app directory.\r\n\r\nTo run locally:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmeteor npm install\r\nmeteor\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Deployment\r\n\r\nKipa is currently deployed to [Galaxy](http://galaxy.meteor.com).  To successfully deploy to Galaxy, invoke the following command from within the app/ directory:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDEPLOY_HOSTNAME=galaxy.meteor.com meteor deploy kipa.meteorapp.com --settings ../settings/settings.json --owner philipmjohnson\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that for this command to work:\r\n\r\n  * You need to have a settings/settings.json file. See the file settings/sample.settings.json for hints on how to construct this file.\r\n\r\n  * You need to be authorized to deploy to philipmjohnson's galaxy account.  See Philip for details.\r\n  \r\n## Live prototype\r\n\r\nA prototype is deployed at: [http://kipa.meteorapp.com](http://kipa.meteorapp.com)",
