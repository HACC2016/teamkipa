New visitors must \"Request authorization\":\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/HACC2016/teamkipa/raw/master/doc/mockups/register.png)\r\n\r\nA new user, once they submit their information, must wait to be authorized by OCCC staff. During that time their home page displays this:\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/HACC2016/teamkipa/raw/master/doc/mockups/authorization-pending.png)\r\n\r\nIf OCCC staff decline the visitor's request for visitation rights, the home page becomes this:\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/HACC2016/teamkipa/raw/master/doc/mockups/authorization-declined.png)\r\n\r\nIf OCCC staff approve the request, the home page enables them to make a visit request:\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/HACC2016/teamkipa/raw/master/doc/mockups/request-visit.png)\r\n\r\nAccording to Denise Johnston, it is OK for such requests to be immediately approved. So, the home page shows the following after selecting a visit time:\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/HACC2016/teamkipa/raw/master/doc/mockups/reserved-visit.png)\r\n\r\nThe user can cancel and re-reserve visits as they like during the seven day interval.\r\n\r\nOnce the visit has happened, the home page goes back to enabling them to reserve a new visit.\r\n\r\nThis workflow involves interaction with OCCC staff for approval processing. Here is the admin page:\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/HACC2016/teamkipa/raw/master/doc/mockups/admin-home-page.png)\r\n\r\nIn order to approve a request to become an authorized visitor, an admin can click on the name of a user requesting this status to go to this page:\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/HACC2016/teamkipa/raw/master/doc/mockups/admin-process-authorization.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nDownload and install the latest version of [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/).\r\n\r\nBring up a shell, and cd into the app directory.\r\n\r\nTo run locally:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmeteor npm install\r\nmeteor\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Deployment\r\n\r\nKipa is currently deployed to [Galaxy](http://galaxy.meteor.com).  To successfully deploy to Galaxy, invoke the following command from within the app/ directory:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDEPLOY_HOSTNAME=galaxy.meteor.com meteor deploy kipa.meteorapp.com --settings ../settings/settings.json --owner philipmjohnson\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that for this command to work:\r\n\r\n  * You need to have a settings/settings.json file. See the file settings/sample.settings.json for hints on how to construct this file.\r\n\r\n  * You need to be authorized to deploy to philipmjohnson's galaxy account.  See Philip for details.\r\n  \r\n## Live prototype\r\n\r\nA prototype is deployed at: [http://kipa.meteorapp.com](http://kipa.meteorapp.com)",
