# Kipa Use Cases

The Kipa system is designed to address two issues in the current OCCC visitation workflow:

  1. *Low communication bandwidth*.  Communication by prospective visitors to OCCC is currently by a single phone line, which is often busy or not staffed.  This creates frustration for OCCC staff and visitors. Kipa improves communication by augmenting the phone line with web-based and text message-based communication.  Prospective visitors can request visits and find out the status of their request via the web. Prospective visitors will also receive text messages reminding them of visit reservations, dress code, documentation, and so forth. If OCCC staff need to cancel visits, they can use Kipa to generate text messages to all affected visitors. 
   
  2. *Procedural breakdowns.* OCCC visitation is subject to strict procedures, and deviations from these procedures can result in long waits to become a visitor, missed visits, or revocation of visitation privileges. Kipa attempts to reduce the number of procedural breakdowns by providing web and text message based information to visitors that inform them of the procedures they need to follow.
