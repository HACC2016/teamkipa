# Use Case: Staff: Block Visitor

If a visitor violates the rules, or if their documentation requires updates, or for any other reason they cannot visit, then OCCC staff can login to the system and select the menu item "Block visitor".

This page enable staff to look up visitors and set their state to blocked and the conditions under which their state can become unblocked. 

It also brings up a field containing a default text message indicating they are now blocked from visiting and what conditions must be satisfied for them to become unblocked. The OCCC Staff member can edit this message if desired.

The OCCC Staff member can click the button "Send" to send the text message or "Cancel" to not send the message.
