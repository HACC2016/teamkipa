# Use Case: Detainee : Update Visitor List

At any time, a detainee can add and remove people from their list of 12 visitors. 

When this happens, an OCCC staff member will login to Kipa and select the menu item "Update visitor list".

This page will enable the staff member to find the set of visitors associated with the detainee.

First, the staff member can remove visitors.  For each visitor to be removed, the system will display a template text message to be sent to that visitor indicating to them that they are no longer authorized as a visitor.  The Staff member can edit this message if necessary, then press "Send" to send it or "Cancel" to return to the main menu. (The visitor is still removed.)

New visitors are added using the process documented in [(Staff) Authorize Visitor](usecase-staff-authorize-visitor.md).
