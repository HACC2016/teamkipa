# Use Case: Staff : Schedule visit

An OCCC Staff member can login to the system, and select "View Visit Requests" from the menubar.

This presents a page listing the visit requests from visitors. 

Each visit request has a "Process" button associated with it. When the OCCC staff presses it, it brings up a page where the staff member can indicate the date and time for the visit. 

**Note:** Kipa does not yet replace the spreadsheet associated with visitor scheduling. Instead, the goal of Kipa is to simplify communication. So, the OCCC staff member will update their spreadsheet, then enter the time and date into Kipa. 
  
After OCCC staff indicates the time and date for a visit and presses Submit, the system presents a page with a default text message to be sent to the visitor confirming their time and date of the visit. The OCCC staff member can optionally edit this message.

The OCCC staff member can press "Send" to send the text message, or "Cancel" to not send the message and return the OCCC staff member to the home page.
