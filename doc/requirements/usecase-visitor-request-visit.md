# Use Case: Visitor: Request Visit

Once a user has been authorized by OCCC Staff, they have credentials for logging in to Kipa. 

Upon logging in, Kipa checks their user state and for this use case to apply, their state is RequestVisit.

The system presents a page which enables users to request a visit. They can specify a range of times and dates that would work for them. 

They can only request a visit within the next seven days. (?) There may be other constraints on what must be put on this page.
