# Use Case: Detainee : Submit visitor list

Each detainee can provide a list of up to 12 visitors who can be authorized to visit.  

Once the detainee provides that list, those potential visitors are contacted to submit the required documentation.

During the first 30 days, immediate family can visit as long as they have the required documentation.

For the initial release of the system, we do not plan to provide automated support for this aspect of visitation.
