# Use Case: Visitor: Obtain initial authorization

A prospective visitor for a detainee at OCCC visits the Kipa site home page. 

They click on a button labeled "Learn about visitation". This takes them to a page providing details on the procedure to be used to become an authorized visitor.  To be an authorized visitor, the detainee must have included the person on their list of authorized visitors. 

The Kipa system will not provide support for this initial authorization process beyond providing general information about the procedures to be followed. A prospective visitor will not submit their documentation using Kipa. The traditional submission process for documentation continues to be followed. The role of Kipa at this time is simply to provide online documentation on the procedure (or links to the pages where such documentation is provided.)
