# Use Case: Visitor: Obtain initial authorization

A prospective visitor for a detainee at OCCC visits the Kipa site home page. 

They click on a button labeled "Become authorized". This takes them to a page providing details on the procedure to be used to become an authorized visitor.

**Note:** they do not submit their documentation using Kipa. The current submission process is followed. The role of Kipa at this time is simply to provide online documentation on the procedure (or links to the pages where such documentation is provided.)
